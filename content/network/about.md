Our network is designed to allow people to easily deploy their own
remote sensors and connect them up to the Internet - without the need
of mobile data contacts or the worry of building and managing a
wireless infrastructure.

To achieve this, we build on top of a technology known as
LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN is a network layer protocol that utilises LoRa to
facilitate the creation of wide area networks.  LoRa's long-range, low
power requirements and use of ISM bands (in this case 868MHz) makes it
ideal for 'Internet of Things' type sensors. A single gateway within a
LoRaWAN network can easily achieve 15miles of connectivity outside of
urban environements and provide connectivity to hundreds of sensors.

To make it easy for people to deploy their own sensors,we use The
Things Network as part of our
infrastructure. [The Things Network][ttn] is about creating an
open-source, decentralized network to exchange data with sensors and
applications.
