Kent.Network is a volunteer-run organisation and our members are our
most vital asset. We welcome members of all abilities and backgrounds,

and learn from each other.
 
## What sort of things can I do?
 
Some of the ways you can get involved:
 
 - Use the data! 
 - Develop new types of sensors or improve existing designs.
 - <i>Develop new applications</i> Build new services that benefit the
   community
 - <i>Maintain the sensor network</i> Replacing batteries, recovering /
   deploying units.
 - <i>Host a network gateway</i> In a good locale? What to help fill dead
   zones?
 - <i>Help construct and maintain the network gateways</i> Interested in
   radio? then might be the role for you!
